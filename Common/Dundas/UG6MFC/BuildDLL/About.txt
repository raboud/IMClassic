*** Linking to Ultimate Grid built into a DLL ***

When linking to the Ultimate Grid (that is built as a DLL) define _LINK_TO_UG_IN_EXTDLL in your project and specify the path for the UG header files and the location of the compiled library.

The "BuildDLL" project can generate 4 variations of the Ultimate Grid DLL:

 - UGMFCD.dll (UGMFCD.lib)      - Ansi Debug
 - UGMFC.dll (UGMFC.lib)        - Ansi Release
 - UGMFCDU.dll (UGMFCDU.lib)    - UNICODE Debug
 - UGMFCU.dll (UGMFCU.lib)      - UNICODE Release

To simplify selection of the file you should be linking to we have created a simple routine, which is demonstrated in:

        "<UG install folder>\Examples\Use UG DLL\StdAfx.h"

*** Building Ultimate Grid into a DLL ***

The Ultimate Grid 6.1 has a new define (_BUILD_UG_INTO_EXTDLL), and once defined will mark for export all of the UG classes, including additional celltypes and edit controls.  To simplify this process we have introduced "BuildDLL" project that will build a UG DLL including all additional celltypes and edit controls.
