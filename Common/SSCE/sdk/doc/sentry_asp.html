   This document describes how a server-based application implemented 
   using ASP (Active Server Pages) can use Sentry Spelling Checker 
   Engine to check the spelling of text submitted in Web-page forms. 
   When used this way, the spelling check is performed on the server.</P>
  <P>
   This document assumes familiarity with ASP pages, Web servers, HTML, 
   VBScript, and capabilities of the Sentry Spelling Checker Engine.</P>
  <H3>
   <TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="2">
    <TR>
     <TD WIDTH="100%" VALIGN=CENTER>

    </TR>
   </TABLE></H3>
  <P>
   The Sentry DLL (ssce5332.dll) cannot be called by VBScript directly. 
   Instead, the Sentry DLL is accessed through an ActiveX DLL called 
   SentryASC.DLL, which in turn calls ssce5332.dll. SentryASC.DLL is a 
   &quot;thin wrapper&quot; around the Sentry API, meaning it forwards 
   API calls to the Sentry DLL and does very little processing.</P>
  <P>
   SentryASC.DLL defines methods which implement the functions in the <A HREF="coreapi.htm">Core
    Sentry API</A> and <A HREF="winapi.htm">Sentry Windows API</A>. 
   Parameter sequence and types used in SentryASC.DLL are very similar 
   to the parameters used in the Sentry APIs with the following exceptions:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI>
   <P>
    All output parameters and in/out parameters are declared as type Variant.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Most string-length parameters have been removed. SentryASC.DLL 
    changes the size of output string parameters as necessary to 
    accommodate the string contents, so the size parameters are 
    unnecessary. For example, the SSCE_CheckWord function in the Core 
    Sentry API includes an otherWord parameter (an output string) and an 
    otherWordSz parameter (which indicates the capacity of the otherWord 
    parameter in characters). SentryASC.DLL includes a CheckWord method 
    that returns the otherWord parameter as a string. The size of the 
    string is set (by SentryASC.DLL) to the size of the other word, so 
    the otherWordSz parameter isn't needed.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    The Suggest method returns suggestions as an array of words rather 
    than a single text block containing multiple null-terminated words. 
    Each individual suggestion returned by the Suggest method can be 
    accessed using a simple array index.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Null (0) values cannot be used as placeholders for output parameters 
    whose values are not needed. For example, in the GetBlockInfo method, 
    all parameters must be provided and may not be null.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   See <A HREF="#APIRef">Sentry ASC API Reference</A> for API syntax.</P>
  <P>
   Several clients may request a spelling check concurrently. The Sentry 
   DLL supports concurrent access, provided each thread of execution 
   uses its own Sentry session (i.e., the OpenSession method is called 
   for each thread). This would require that lexicons (dictionaries) be 
   opened for each thread, which would consume processor time and 
   memory. An alternative approach, used by the Sentry ASP demo program, 
   is to open one session for all clients, and call Application.Lock to 
   ensure only one thread uses the Sentry session at a time. In ASP 
   pages used by large numbers of clients, this may result in delays. 
   The SSCE_GetSid function (or the GetSid method in SentryASC.DLL) 
   should not be used to obtain a session id if there is any chance that 
   the Sentry DLL will be used by other application software running on 
   the server.</P>

  <P>
   An application which demonstrates the techniques presented in this 
   document is included with the Sentry Spelling Checker Engine Windows 
   SDK in directory ssce/sdk/examples/asp/example1.</P>
  <P>
   To set up the example do the following:</P>
  <OL>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Edit global.asa in the example1 directory and set the licenseKey 
    variable to your Sentry license key, provided by Wintertree Software. 
    See <A HREF="winapi.htm#AboutLicenseKey">About the Sentry license key</A> 
    for more information.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Copy form.html, default.asp, and global.asa from the example1 
    directory to a directory on the Web server.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Copy ssceam.tlx and ssceam2.clx from the ssce/runtime directory to 
    c:\Program Files\Common Files\Wintertree\Spelling. (Alternatively, 
    copy the files to another directory, and edit the statement that sets 
    the &quot;lexPath&quot; variable in global.asa to point to the directory.)</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Create a virtual Web directory named &quot;sentry&quot; which points 
    to the directory on your Web server where you copied the global.asa 
    file in a previous step. Make sure this directory has &quot;read&quot;
     and &quot;scripts&quot; permissions set.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Copy ssce5332.dll from the windows\system (or windows\system32) 
    directory on your development computer (the computer where the Sentry 
    Spelling Checker Engine Windows SDK was installed) to the 
    windows\system32 directory on the Web server.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Make sure a copy of MSVBVM60.DLL is installed on the server. This DLL 
    contains the Visual Basic run-time library, and is needed by 
    SentryASC.DLL. You can <A HREF="ftp://ftp.wintertree-software.com/pub/msvbvm60.zip">download
     this file from Wintertree Software's FTP site</A>.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Copy SentryASC.DLL to any directory on your Web server. Run regsvr32 
    to register SentryASC.DLL. If you don't have a copy of regsvr32 on 
    your system, <A HREF="ftp://ftp.wintertree-software.com/pub/regsvrd.exe">download
     regsvrd</A> and use it to register SentryASC.DLL like this:</P><PRE>regsvrd SentryASC.DLL</PRE></OL><P>
   To run the example, enter the URL of the virtual &quot;sentry&quot; 
   directory in a Web browser:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>http://hostname/sentry</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>
   The example works with either Netscape or Internet Explorer.</P>

  <P>
   The example application consists of three parts:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI>
   <P>
    form.html: An HTML page which includes a simple form containing a 
    text area and buttons labelled &quot;Check Spelling&quot; and &quot;Submit.&quot;</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    default.asp: An ASP page which includes VBScript code which is 
    executed on the server plus HTML which is sent to the client browser 
    for display.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    global.asa: A file containing Application_OnStart and 
    Application_OnEnd event handlers, which perform initialization and 
    termination functions.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   The form in form.html (named &quot;demoForm&quot;) has 
   &quot;default.asp&quot; as its ACTION attribute. When the form is 
   submitted, its contents are posted to default.asp on the server. The 
   form is submitted if either the &quot;Check Spelling&quot; or 
   &quot;Submit&quot; buttons are pressed. If the &quot;Check 
   Spelling&quot; button is pressed, the spelling of any text entered 
   into the text area is checked, and any misspelled words and 
   suggestions are displayed.</P>
  <H2>
   <TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="2">
    <TR>
     <TD WIDTH="100%" VALIGN=CENTER>
      <H3>
       <A NAME="DemoClient"></A>Client</TD>
    </TR>
   </TABLE></H2>
  <P>
   Form.html contains the demoForm form. The form contains two 
   SUBMIT-type buttons, labelled &quot;Submit&quot; and &quot;Check 
   Spelling.&quot; Pressing either button causes the browser to submit 
   the form to default.asp on the server.</P>
  <H2>
   <TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="2">
    <TR>
     <TD WIDTH="100%" VALIGN=CENTER>
      <H3>
       <A NAME="DemoServer"></A>Server</TD>
    </TR>
   </TABLE></H2>
  <H4>
   Default.asp</H4>
  <P>
   When the URL of the virtual directory is opened, the Web server 
   invokes default.asp. In response, default.asp reads the contents of 
   form.html and returns the HTML stream it contains. This causes the 
   browser to display an empty form.</P>
  <P>
   When the user clicks the &quot;Submit&quot; or &quot;Check 
   Spelling&quot; buttons in the form, the browser submits the form to 
   default.asp. Default.asp examines the VALUE attribute of the button 
   which caused the submission to determine what action to take next.</P>
  <P>
   If the &quot;Check Spelling&quot; button was pressed, the spelling of 
   text in the textArea1 field is checked. Otherwise, the form is 
   submitted as normal. In this example, a normal submission does 
   nothing interesting, but in your application it will do whatever is necessary.</P>
  <P>
   If a spelling check is requested, default.asp calls the CheckString 
   method to check the text submitted in the form. In the demo, the 
   words in the text are spell-checked and never replaced, so we don't 
   have to leave room for the text to grow (as would happen if a word 
   was replaced by a longer word). The CheckString method returns when 
   it finds a misspelled word or when it reaches the end of the text. 
   When a misspelled word is found, default.asp calls the Suggest method 
   to obtain suggested replacements, and the misspelled word and 
   suggestions are saved. Looking up suggestions can be time consuming, 
   so default.asp is careful not to do this if the misspelled word was 
   encountered previously.</P>
  <P>
   After all words in the text have been checked (as signaled by a 
   return value from the CheckString method), the misspelled words and 
   their suggestions are formatted and returned to the client in an 
   updated copy of form.html, including the original text and the 
   spelling-check results.</P>
  <H4>
   Global.asa</H4>
  <P>
   The global.asa file contains two event handlers: Application_OnStart 
   and Application_OnEnd. Application_OnStart is invoked by the Web 
   server when an ASP application in the virtual directory is first 
   started (since default.asp is the only ASP application in the virtual 
   directory, Application_OnStart will be called the first time a 
   browser opens the virtual directory's URL). Application_OnStart opens 
   a Sentry session (by calling the OpenSession method), and opens the 
   American English lexicon within that session. You can modify 
   Application_OnStart in global.asa to open other lexicons if desired. 
   The Sentry session id returned by the OpenSession method is saved as 
   the &quot;SSCESid&quot; application variable. This Sentry session id 
   is shared by all clients. Note that a Sentry &quot;session&quot; is 
   different from and has nothing to do with an ASP &quot;session.&quot; 
   All ASP &quot;sessions&quot; (or, more accurately, by all instances 
   of the default.asp application) share the same Sentry &quot;session.&quot;</P>
  <P>
   Default.asp is designed to support multiple clients and to correctly 
   handle the situation where multiple clients request a spelling check 
   simultaneously. Sentry sessions were not designed to be shared by 
   multiple concurrent processing threads, so Application.Lock is used 
   to ensure that only one ASP session uses the Sentry session at a 
   time. Any call to a function in the Sentry API is bracketed by calls 
   to Application.Lock and Application.Unlock.</P>
  <P>
   An alternative approach would involve opening one Sentry session per 
   ASP session (i.e., per application instance). This approach would 
   make it unnecessary to share Sentry session ids, and it would 
   therefore not be necessary to call Application.Lock. However, each 
   open Sentry session would need its own set of dictionaries, resulting 
   in significant memory consumption if a large number of clients 
   requested a spelling check.</P>
  <P>
   The Sentry API includes the GetSid function, which returns the Sentry 
   session id automatically opened by the Sentry DLL. This session has 
   dictionaries and option settings made from values in the system 
   registry. Although it would be very convenient to use this function 
   rather than opening a session, opening dictionaries, and setting 
   options, doing so in a server environment is risky. The GetSid 
   function is available to all applications running on the server 
   computer. A desktop application or another ASP application running on 
   the same server might also use the Sentry session id returned by 
   GetSid, and this would result in the unsynchronized sharing of a 
   session id, which is not safe. Calling Application.Lock in this 
   situation would not help, since Application.Lock locks instances of 
   the current ASP application and has no effect on other ASP 
   applications or desktop applications.</P>
  <P>
   The Application_OnEnd event handler is called by the server when it 
   shuts down. Application_OnEnd closes the Sentry session, which also 
   closes any lexicons open within the session.</P>
