   This Programmer's Guide describes how to use the Sentry 
   Spelling-Checker Engine (SSCE) with a software application. This 
   document applies to the Sentry Spelling Checker Engine Windows SDK 
   (Software Development Kit) and the Sentry Spelling Checker Engine 
   Source SDK. Information that is specific to one SDK is clearly 
   indicated as such; otherwise, information applies to both SDKs.</P>

   The Sentry Spelling Checker Engine is a library you can use to add a 
   spelling-checker capability to your applications. Sentry is intended 
   for software developers and application builders. Sentry is not a 
   stand-alone spelling checker; it must be used within an application. 
   The Sentry engine is available as 16- and 32-bit SDKs (Software 
   Development Kits) for Microsoft Windows, a portable C-language Source 
   SDK, a Java class library, and Java source code. All SDK types 
   include an API (Application Program Interface) you can use to check 
   the spelling of words, add words to user dictionaries, get suggested 
   replacements for misspelled words, etc. The Windows SDKs include 
   built-in spelling checker dialog boxes, and have an augmented API 
   that includes functions specific to the Windows environment.</P>
  <P>
   This programmer's guide applies to the Sentry Windows SDK and the C 
   Source SDK. Each SDK includes:</P>

   Sentry provides a general-purpose spelling-checker capability for 
   software applications. You can use Sentry from your application to 
   check the spelling of words (e.g., in a word-processor application) 
   or to classify text strings as words (e.g., in an OCR or 
   handwriting-recognition application).</P>
  <P>
   Using the Sentry spelling-checker engine is a co-operative venture 
   between your application and Sentry's API.</P>
  <P>
   Sentry provides:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Fast word lookups in any number of lexicons (dictionaries)</P>
   <LI>

    Highly compressed lexicons</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Support for multi-lingual lexicons with words formed from the Latin 1 
    (ISO-8859-1) character set. Through a special build option, the 
    Source SDK can support the Unicode character set.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Checking for uncapitalized words, words with unusual case 
    combinations, doubled words, and words containing embedded digits</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Checking of individual words or blocks of text</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Intelligent suggested replacements for misspelled words using 
    phonetic and typographical matching</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Support for ignore-all and replace-all word processing</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Ability to automatically correct common misspellings</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Ability to automatically suggest specific replacements for certain words</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Ability to mark words as misspelled, even if they exist in other lexicons</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Support for text-lexicon maintenance (adding and removing words)</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Support for undoing corrections made to text</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Ability to automatically expand abbreviations</P>
   <LI>

   Your application provides:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI>
   <P>
    All user interface components (however, a user interface for 
    Microsoft Windows applications is provided with the Windows SDK)</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Extraction of words from a document</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Replacement of corrected words in a document</P>
   <LI>

    <B>Block</B>: A block is a character array (string) containing one or 
    more words. Sentry's Core API contains functions for checking the 
    spelling of and modifying words in blocks.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    <B>Character set</B>: A mechanism for mapping character shapes to 
    numeric values. The Sentry engine supports the Latin 1 character set, 
    and can support the Unicode character set through a special build 
    option (Sentry Source SDK only).</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    <B><A NAME="CompressedLexicon"></A>Compressed lexicon</B>: A 
    compressed lexicon is a set of words in compressed form. Like a text 
    lexicon, a compressed lexicon contains words, but the words are 
    stored in a special form that eliminates redundancies so the words 
    occupy less space. On average, a compressed lexicon is slower to 
    access than a text lexicon. Words cannot be added to or removed from 
    a compressed lexicon. Compressed lexicons can hold hundreds of 
    thousands of words. See also <A HREF="#Lexicon">Lexicon</A> and <A HREF="#TextLexicon">Text
     lexicon</A>.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    <B>Latin 1</B>: A standard method of mapping character shapes to 
    single-byte numerical values. Characters with values ranging from 0 
    to 127 are identical to the ASCII character set. Characters with 
    codes above 127 are used to represent accented characters. Latin 1, 
    also known as ISO-8859-1, is the same as the ANSI character set used 
    in Microsoft Windows and other operating systems.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    <B><A NAME="Lexicon"></A>Lexicon</B>: A lexicon is a set of words. 
    Some spelling checkers use the term &quot;dictionary&quot; to 
    describe the set of words they use.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    <B>Lexicon format</B>: The organization and structure of a lexicon. 
    Sentry supports two lexicon formats: text, which hold at most a few 
    thousand words and are modifiable, and compressed, which can hold an 
    unlimited number of words but are not modifiable.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    <B>Main lexicon</B>: The main lexicon is a large collection of 
    commonly used words in a specific language. The main lexicon is 
    normally compressed and is not modifiable by users at run-time.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    <B><A NAME="PermanentLexicon"></A>Permanent lexicon</B>: Words in a 
    permanent lexicon are saved to disk when the lexicon is updated. When 
    the lexicon is reopened, its words will be restored from its disk 
    image. Compressed lexicons are always permanent; text lexicons may be 
    permanent or temporary. See also <A HREF="#TemporaryLexicon">Temporary
     lexicon</A>.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    <B>Suggestion</B>: The Sentry engine can suggest alternative words 
    which are likely replacements for a misspelled word. For example, if 
    the misspelled word is <I>stopp</I>, Sentry might suggest <I>stop</I>,
     <I>steppe</I>, <I>stopped</I>, etc. Sentry will locate the n best 
    alternative replacements for a word; your application determines how 
    large n is.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    <B><A NAME="TemporaryLexicon"></A>Temporary lexicon</B>: Words in a 
    temporary lexicon exist only while the lexicon is open. Once the 
    lexicon is closed, the words are lost. Only text lexicons may be 
    temporary. See also <A HREF="#PermanentLexicon">Permanent lexicon</A>.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    <B><A NAME="TextLexicon"></A>Text lexicon</B>: A text lexicon is a 
    set of words in text form. Words can be added to or removed from a 
    text lexicon. Text lexicons are generally fast to access, but they 
    take up more space per word than compressed lexicons. Text lexicons 
    are sometimes called &quot;user lexicons&quot; or &quot;user 
    dictionaries.&quot; See also <A HREF="#CompressedLexicon">Compressed lexicon</A>.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    <B>Unicode</B>: A standard way of mapping character shapes to 
    double-byte numerical values. Unicode can represent character shapes 
    in virtually all human languages.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    <B>User lexicon</B>: See <A HREF="#TextLexicon">Text lexicon</A>.</P>
